Took me a minute to set this up! Got all turned around with templates and whatnot. Good to go, though!

Wow! React feels like having super powers haha :D I'm barely scratching the surface but I can already see how useful this thing is to use. No wonder it took off. I really like holding my HTML close. I always really enjoy writing HTML, so being able to blend it with JS is really fun.

It took me a few hours today, but I think I understand how to "lift states" to a parent component. It's pretty clever I think. I only have a few simple components working together, but it feels like a major step. Using props in this way feels a bit heady. But I'm steadily getting more comfortable.

I should go to bed. It's been a long day.
