Took me a minute to set this up! Got all turned around with templates and whatnot. Good to go, though!

Wow! React feels like having super powers haha :D I'm barely scratching the surface but I can already see how useful this thing is to use. No wonder it took off. I really like holding my HTML close. I always really enjoy writing HTML, so being able to blend it with JS is really fun.
